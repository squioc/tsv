# TSV

TSV is a library (and a set of tool) to manipulate Tabular separated values.

It is inspired by [solidsnack/tsv](github.com/solidsnack/tsv) and thoughts from Donald Merand: [TSV - The Best Spreadsheet Format](https://donaldmerand.com/code/2011/09/20/tsv-the-best-spreadsheet-format.html)

## Installation

    $ go get github.com/squioc/tsv/pkg/tsv
